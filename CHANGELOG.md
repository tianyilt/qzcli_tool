# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Breaking**: `qzcli res -u` now defaults to **quick mode** — skips the unbounded historical-jobs walk and pulls `compute_groups` / `projects` directly from `get_cluster_basic_info` / `list_task_dimension`. On shared workspaces (e.g. `分布式训练空间`) this drops a full refresh from "hangs for tens of minutes" to seconds-to-a-couple-minutes. Trade-off: `specs` are no longer refreshed in the default path. Pass `--full` / `-F` to opt back into the legacy full scan (still required when you need fresh spec ids for `cmd_create` non-interactive). The `--quick` / `-q` flag is preserved as a no-op for backward compatibility with existing scripts. `create -i` still uses the full scan internally because submission needs spec ids.
- `qzcli res -u` now shows a live progress bar during workspace cache refresh, sharing the rich `display.create_progress()` pattern from `qzcli avail`.
- Reapply most of PR #23 (cookie auth for `get_job_detail` / `stop_job`, `qz_get_hpc_usage` unpacking fix, `qz_track_job` error propagation). The `_get_token` encrypt-password change is intentionally *not* reapplied — the `{"encrypted": True}` flag is not part of `/auth/token`'s documented contract and likely doesn't help CAS-federated users with `invalid_grant` anyway. Issue #14 remains open.
- `qzcli create` and the `qz_create_job` MCP tool now build the `/api/v1/train_job/create` payload using the platform's new `resource_spec_price` schema. The legacy `framework_config[0].spec_id` field is no longer sent (the platform rejects it with `unknown field "spec_id"`). `cpu` / `mem_gi` / `gpu_count` are also promoted to `framework_config[0]` to satisfy the same endpoint's `Cpu and Mem can't be empty.` check.
- `qzcli create` now prefers cookie auth (`/api/v1/train_job/create`) by default and only falls back to the openapi token path when no cookie is available — this aligns the CLI with `qz_create_job` and unblocks CAS-federated users who previously got `invalid_grant`.
- New public helper `qzcli.api.build_resource_spec_price(spec_obj, compute_group_id)` shared by CLI and MCP. New CLI helper `_lookup_spec_for_payload` auto-refreshes the spec cache when cpu/gpu/memory fields are missing, and gives a `qzcli res -u` hint if still unresolved.

## v0.2.0 - 2026-05-04

qzcli v0.2.0 is the first tagged release for the project, collecting the recent work on job logs, WSL/VPN networking, faster capacity checks, MCP integration, interactive workloads, and HPC/CPU job submission into a versioned release.

## Highlights

- WSL/VPN Proxy Support: Add config-driven SOCKS and HTTP(S) proxy routing across OpenAPI calls, cookie-authenticated APIs, `/api/v2` calls, and CAS login, including explicit handling for WSL/Clash setups where `HTTPS_PROXY=http://...` can override a SOCKS proxy, plus a declared `PySocks` dependency for reliable installation: #13
- Fast Availability Queries: Preserve cached fuzzy workspace matching, avoid slow full workspace scans for targeted `qzcli avail -w` queries, parallelize node/task dimension fetches, increase low-priority task pagination, add progress display, and reduce measured local `qzcli avail` runtime from about 49.7s to about 5.9s in the optimized path: #17
- Job Logs CLI: Add `qzcli logs <job-id>` backed by `/api/v2/train?Action=GetJobLog` with cookie authentication, chronological tail output, `--tail`, `--follow`, `--raw`, `--json`, `--pod`, and `--since` support, plus documentation and clearer login failure hints: #16, 0e66dc4, 0d6c706, 16fed90
- Job Creation and MCP Workflows: Add `qzcli create`, `qzcli batch`, MCP job creation tools, cookie-based job creation fallback, optional MCP login credential resolution, and interactive job submission with auto-login support: #7, #12, #13
- Interactive and HPC Workloads: Add dev-machine listing, Jupyter-terminal based remote command execution, HPC/CPU job submission, HPC command documentation, and HPC CPU/memory utilization in availability output: #9, #10, 93e40a6, fa8cc23
- Login and Workspace Reliability: Fix CAS RSA ciphertext encoding when leading zero bytes are present, handle passwords with special characters, move workspace overview to the new platform endpoint, and keep backward-compatible workspace flags as deprecated no-ops: #8, #11, 4cf71ce, ed10a5f

## Upgrade Notes

- No known breaking changes; Python support remains `>=3.8`.
- SOCKS proxy users should install updated dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- WSL users can configure a Windows-side Clash proxy with `{"proxy": "socks5://127.0.0.1:7897"}` in `~/.qzcli/config.json`.
- `qzcli logs` and other `/api/v2` calls require cookie authentication; run `qzcli login` again if a command reports an expired or missing cookie.

## Dependencies

- Add `PySocks>=1.7` so SOCKS proxy support works after a normal requirements install: #13

## Validation

- `python3 -m compileall qzcli tests`
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (54 passed, 1 skipped)

- Add sii-cas-auth auto login password encryption: #1
- Unify `avail` table output and improve formatting: #2
- Add qzcli MCP server support: #6

- Support SOCKS5 proxy for WSL/VPN environments: #13
- Document `qzcli logs`: #16
- Preserve cached workspace matches and speed up `qzcli avail`: #17
